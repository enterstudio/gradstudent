# Data critique

re: the assignment for [Sept. 23, 2014](http://www.padjo.org/2014-09-23/), a critique of [LAPD Misclassifying Nearly 1200 violent cases as nonviolent](http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-crimestats-lapd-20140810-story.html#page=1)

### What are the datasets used here, and where did they come from?

1. The testimony of two dozen current and retired LAPD officers
2. A year's worth of LAPD data — from early October 2012 through September 2013 — obtained through public records requests
 - The information included brief summaries of officers' reports for more than 94,000 crimes and showed how the incidents were classified


### What is the “birth story” of the data?

*(How were they created in the first place?)*

The LA Times reporters on the case compiled reports from the past year to gauge the level of severity.

 - Reporters searched the summaries for terms such as "stab" and "knife" to flag incidents that might meet the FBI criteria for serious offenses
 - They then read thousands of the summaries
 - They reviewed court and police records for dozens of cases


### What claims does the story make based on the data?

The Times uncovered the following material:

> Nearly all the misclassified crimes were actually aggravated assaults. If those incidents had been recorded correctly, the total aggravated assaults for the 12-month period would have been almost 14% higher than the official figure.

> The tally for violent crime overall would have been nearly 7% higher.

Although some of the misclassification could be viewed as human error, that would involve minor crimes being labeled as serious, but this almost never happened, according to data.

As a result of the data, the LAPD took to stricter standards in reporting crimes, which in turn showed the rate of aggravated assault rising nearly 12%.


### What are the limitations of the data?

I found the data to be quite comprehensive, especially considering the fact that numerous law enforcement officials were cooperative and agreed to be interviewed.   


### Can you find where this (original) data exists online? If so, post the relevant URLs. 

The original data and case reports are not online.
